# Images & media

GitBook allows you to add images and media easily to your docs. Simply drag a file into the editor, or use the file manager in the upper right corner to upload multiple images at once.

You can also add images simply by copying and pasting them directly into the editor â€” and GitBook will automatically add it to your file manager.
