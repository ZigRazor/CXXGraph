GitBook supports many different types of content, and is backed by Markdown — meaning you can copy and paste any existing Markdown files directly into the editor!

Feel free to test it out and copy the Markdown below by hovering over the code block in the upper right, and pasting into a new line underneath.

```markdown

This is some paragraph text, with a [link](https://docs.gitbook.com) to our docs. 

## Heading 2
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3
```

If you have multiple files, GitBook makes it easy to import full repositories too — allowing you to keep your GitBook content in sync.
