[Kruskal Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) can be used to find the minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph.  Time Complexity `O(E log E) = O(E log V)` where;
- V is number of vertices and;
-  E is number of edges in graph. The main speed limitation for this algorithm is sorting the edges.

For a quick understanding of the algorithm procedure, check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71UQH7Pr9kU).
Some of the real life applications are:

- LAN/TV Network
- Tour Operations
- Water/gas pipe network
- Electric grid

Other algorithms to find the minimum spanning forest are Prim's algorithm or Bor≈Øvka's algorithm.
