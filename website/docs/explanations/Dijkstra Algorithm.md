**[Graph Dijkstras Shortest Path Algorithm(Dijkstra's Shortest Path)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)** is used to find the shortest path from a source node to all other reachable nodes in the graph. The algorithm initially assumes all the nodes are unreachable from the given source node so we mark the distances of all nodes as infinity.
(infinity) from source node (INF / infinity denotes unable to reach).
