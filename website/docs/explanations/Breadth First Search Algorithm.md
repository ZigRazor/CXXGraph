**[Breadth First Search Algorithm(Breadth First Search)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)**, also quoted as **BFS**, is a Graph Traversal Algorithm. Time Complexity `O(|V| + |E|) ` where V are the number of vertices and E are the number of edges in the graph.
Applications of Breadth First Search are :

 1. Finding shortest path between two vertices say u and v, with path length measured by number of edges (an advantage over depth first search algorithm)
 2. Ford-Fulkerson Method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network.
 3. Testing bipartiteness of a graph.
 4. Cheney's Algorithm, Copying garbage collection.

  And there are many more...
