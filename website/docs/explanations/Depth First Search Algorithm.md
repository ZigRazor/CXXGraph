**[Depth First Search Algorithm (Depth First Search)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)**, also quoted as **DFS**, is a Graph Traversal Algorithm. Time Complexity O(|V| + |E|) where V is number of vertices and E is number of edges in graph.
Application of Depth First Search are:

  1. Finding connected components
  2. Finding 2-(edge or vertex)-connected components.
  3. Finding 3-(edge or vertex)-connected components.
  4. Finding the bridges of a graph.
  5. Generating words in order to plot the limit set of a group.
  6. Finding strongly connected components.

  And there are many more...
